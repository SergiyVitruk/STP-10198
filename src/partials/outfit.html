        As you complete levels, you collect pieces of
        <span>fashionable outfits</span>. Each set is tied to a chapter in your
        character’s love story. From casual coffee-date looks to runway-inspired
        evening wear, each chapter comes with its own aesthetic — and each match
        you make brings you closer to completing the ensemble.
